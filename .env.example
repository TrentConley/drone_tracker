# --- Face Recognizer Model Configuration ---
# Used by face_recognizer.py
# Set to true to attempt using GPU acceleration:
# - On Linux/Windows: Attempts to use CUDA (requires onnxruntime-gpu and compatible drivers/CUDA toolkit).
# - On macOS: Attempts to use MPS via CoreML (requires onnxruntime >= 1.10+).
# If the corresponding GPU provider isn't found, it falls back to CPU.
